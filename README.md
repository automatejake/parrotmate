# Parrot Mate
This is a HackNYU project that was built from 2/15/19-2/17/19.  This is a clone of the original repo which is private because it contains a google API key.  The application features a chat board that displays text in a person's native language (among over 100 choices), an interactive quiz, and a question/answer forum.  The project was built using the Next.JS framework which packages Express and React into a single server with shared dependencies and runtime.
